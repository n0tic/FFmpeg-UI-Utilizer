WIP! (Currently shelfed)

FFMPEG Utilizer is a user-friendly UI software that executes commands based on user input, by utilizing external ffmpeg. Its primary aim is to be highly portable and lightweight. Furthermore, the integration of a Chrome extension facilitates the exchange of information between the browser and the software, thus enhancing the efficiency.

FFMPEG Utilizer is NOT affiliated, associated, endorsed by, or in any way officially connected with FFmpeg.
[FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) itself is a complete, cross-platform solution to record, convert and stream audio and video. 


#### Backstory: 
The main purpose was to eliminate the need for batch files or manual CMD inputs by using a program to generate the arguments and run ffmpeg with minimal manual labour. It has since grown and expanded beyond what was initially intended.
Initial need was to convert a filetype and encode to another.

This feature is supposed to filter connections and limit to browser requests.
Check if the request match our specific GET request for adding a URL to our software. 
If the request is satisfactory the request will be handled and the data added to our software. 
The idea is intended to be working hand in hand with a browser extension. 
```
```
For now, this inputs work:
http://127.0.0.1:{PORT}?addName=GoogleTestHLS&addURL=http://google.se/hls.m3u8
This will add the required information automatically to our software.

## Requirements

To run FFMPEG Utilizer you will need:

```
.Net Framework 4.6 
```

-----

For full functionallity:
- [.Net Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48130)
- Internet Connection (Turns off Internet features if not available.)
- ffmpeg.exe (Download feature included. Requires Internet Connection.)
- ffplay.exe (Download feature included. Requires Internet Connection.)

This software needs .NET Framework 4.6 minumum to run.
The software itself will need ffmpeg and ffplay to be able to execute requested commands. The software has a built-in feature to automatically download and unpack the latest build from Gyan.
```

```
[See Source URL](FFmpeg%20Utilizer/Core/Core.cs#L243) - [Check out Gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)
## Install

[.Net Framework 4.6](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=48130) Download location.


The software itself is portable and does not need to be installed. Make sure you have .Net Framework installed and simply unpack and run FFMPEG_Utilizer.exe.

## Bugs

First off, this project is a work in progress (WIP) and will have unfinished features scattered.
I am no pro when it comes to using FFmpeg so the arguments FFmpeg Utilizer generates may not be working well with all codecs.
So the results of the process may not be 100% satsfactory. Please leave your feedback and or information regarding features you feel are missing or wrong.

~ Protytyping first, polishing later.
